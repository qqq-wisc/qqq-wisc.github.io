We're working on a robust end-to-end compiler for quantum programs to keep up with a 
rapidly evolving hardware landscape. You can find our software at our [Github organization](https://github.com/qqq-wisc/).

## Projects
``wisq`` - A powerful compiler that integrates ``guoq`` (a circuit optimizer) and ``dascot`` (a fault-tolerant mapping and routing solver) \
[code](https://github.com/qqq-wisc/wisq)

``guoq`` - Unify rewrite rules and circuit resynthesis to optimize circuits \
[paper](files/asplos25.pdf)  |  [code](https://github.com/qqq-wisc/guoq)

``queso`` - Automatically synthesize a circuit optimizer given a set of basis gates \
[paper](files/pldi23.pdf)  |  [code](https://github.com/qqq-wisc/queso)

``satmap`` - Map qubits and route two qubit gates while minimizing SWAP operations \
[paper](files/micro22.pdf)  |  [code](https://github.com/qqq-wisc/satmap)

Benchmark Suite - Evaluate your compiler with quantum compiler with a comprehensive set of test circuits \
